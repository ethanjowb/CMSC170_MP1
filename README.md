Creating an algorithm to solve puzzle 8

Algorithm used is an A* search algorithm where it calculates the manhattan value and the number of steps it took to get to that value.

Steps is evaluated by having the calculating manhattan value + steps out of all the steps it simulated then choose the smallest calculation it has.
